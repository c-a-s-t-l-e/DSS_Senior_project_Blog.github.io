This post will be about my passion, regex, and how it ties into a project at work that I was lucky enough to have been put in charge of.
AWS Textract cleaning project

Something about putting myself out there to be a regex expert and bc of that I have been able to use it every day at work
Jouney to use this project to find out mor about regex and to help share it in a fun undaunting way
